# bike-share-udacity-project

This is project in the Data Analysis Professional Nanodegree Program on Udacity, 
where I use three datasets for many major cities in the US, to uncover bike share usage pattern.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57).
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53).
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776).
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave).
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave).
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer).

In this repo, you will find the source code needed to answer the following questions: 

- 1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- 2 Popular stations and trip
- 3 Trip duration
- 4 User info
